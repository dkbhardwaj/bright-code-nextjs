The system was slow, delivered irrelevant results, and lacked personalization and analytics, leading to a poor user experience. To resolve these issues, the college partnered with Bright Code programmers to implement Algolia's advanced search solutions. The project took just one month to implement and included iterative improvements such as defining searchable attributes, creating custom rankings, and optimizing search requests. This resulted in a faster, more personalized, and relevant search experience, significantly boosting user engagement and satisfaction.",
